Their ability to hold long-form, natural language interactions with users makes them excellent resources for exploring school- and university-level topics in a dynamic, active manner. We compare students'experiences when interacting with an LLM companion in two capacities: tutored learning and learning-by-teaching. We do this using Chrysalis, an LLM-based system that we have designed to support both AI tutors and AI teachable agents for any topic. Through a within-subject exploratory study with 36 participants, we present insights into student preferences between the two strategies and how constructs such as intellectual humility vary between these two interaction modes. To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a direct comparison study on the effects of using an LLM as a tutor versus as a teachable agent on multiple topics. We hope that our work opens up new avenues for future research in this area.",

Depending on the targeted processes within the living organism, different tracers are used for various medical conditions, such as cancer, particular brain pathologies, cardiac events, and bone lesions, where the most commonly used tracers are radiolabeled with 18F (e.g., [18F]-FDG and NA [18F]). Oxygen-15 isotope is mostly involved in blood flow measurements, whereas a wide array of 11C-based compounds have also been developed for neuronal disorders according to the affected neuroreceptors, prostate cancer, and lung carcinomas. In contrast, the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique uses gamma-emitting radioisotopes and can be used to diagnose strokes, seizures, bone illnesses, and infections by gauging the blood flow and radio distribution within tissues and organs. The radioisotopes typically used in SPECT imaging are iodine-123, technetium-99m, xenon-133, thallium-201, and indium-111. This systematic review article aims to clarify and disseminate the available scientific literature focused on PET/SPECT radiotracers and to provide an overview of the conducted research within the past decade, with an additional focus on the novel radiopharmaceuticals developed for medical imaging.",
